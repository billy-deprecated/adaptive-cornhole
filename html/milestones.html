            The first milestone involved the breakbeam sensors, which would be attached around the opening to detect when the sack falls in the hole.
            Two sensors were attached at the 1" and 2" mark respectively of the top board opening. We wired them to an arduino and wrote the code to
            detect any breaks in the sensors. The video shows the serial logs going from 'unbroken' to 'broken' as we use our hands to break any of
            the beams

            The second milestone involved the 4 wheels and 4 DC Motors, which would be attached to the bottom board to move then entire thing back and forth.
          We attached the wheels to the dc motors, which were then mounted onto the bottom of the bottom board. We wired all the motors to a motor driver board,
          wired the motor driver board to an arduino, and wrote the code to move the wheels. The video shows the wheels moving forward for 2 seconds, pausing,
          and then moving backwards.

        <p>
          The third milestone involved the motor, rack and pinion; the rack is attached to the top sheet and the motor moves it diagonally.
          The motor is screwed on to the base platform and rotates accordingly increase or decrease the hole size. This video shows the motor moving forward and back,
          and the top sheet moving accordingly.

        <p>
          The fourth milestone involved the camera, which would track where the sack lands relative to the board (on the board, off the board, and how far away
          from going in). The code for the camera utilizes the openCV library. We chose this libary because it allows us to easily detect objects and calculate
          distance using color. The video shows the algorithm detecting the board (blue outline), detecting the sack (red outline), and showing the distance
          from the sack to the hole

        <p>
          The fifth milestone involved getting the arduino and the raspberry pi communicating with eachother. This was needed since the raspberry pi will be running
          the CV algorithm we developed in milestone 4, and sending the appropriate signals to the arduino to trigger certain functions (such as moving the board or 
          changing the hole size. The video shows messages being passed from the arduino (serial monitor shown) to the raspberry pi (terminal shown) and back.
